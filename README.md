# 📘 Achieng Kuir's Final Project: Data Manifesto & Cookbook

Welcome to my final project for CS/MATH-215 (Introduction to Data Science). This repository includes:

- ✍️ A **Data Manifesto**: a personal reflection on what it means to work with data
- 🍳 A **Data Cookbook**: a collection of practical code “recipes” I learned and applied this semester

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

### ✅ `Achieng_Kuir_Data_Manifesto.pdf`
My personal data philosophy, shaped by experiences in this course and inspired by readings like *Data Feminism*, *Everybody Lies*, and *Data Humanism*. It reflects on data ethics, power, people behind the numbers, and what it means to be a human-centered data scientist.

### ✅ `Achieng_Kuir_Data_Cookbook.ipynb`
This is a Google Colab notebook that includes four practical data science recipes using real-world datasets I worked with this semester. Each recipe includes code, a description, and an explanation for how it works — designed as a resource I can return to in the future.

#### 🍽️ Cookbook Recipes
| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. How to Clean and Merge Datasets Using `pd.merge()`** | Combines life expectancy and GDP data |
| **2. Two Ways to Visualize Cost vs. Earnings** | Scatterplots using both Matplotlib and Seaborn |
| **3. How to Analyze Listening Patterns with Timestamps** | Spotify history — hour/day breakdown |
| **4. How to Rank Top Schools by Earnings** | Uses `.sort_values()` and `.nlargest()` to identify high-earning colleges |

## 📂 Datasets Used

All necessary datasets are included in the `/data` folder:
- `life-expectancy.csv`
- `gdp-per-capita-worldbank.csv`
- `college_scorecard_2024-1.zip`
- `timestamps.csv`

> ⚠️ Note: The College Scorecard dataset was compressed as a `.zip` to meet GitHub upload size limits. It can be unzipped and used directly in Colab.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

You can open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**. Each section includes all the code and explanations needed to follow along or reuse the technique.
